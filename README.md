# ðŸ¥‡ 120 Years of Olympic Analysis: Data Insights to Medal Prediction

## Description

This project delves into a historical dataset encompassing the modern Olympic Games, spanning from Athens 1896 to Rio 2016. The overarching goal was to unearth patterns, trends, and insights, thereby enriching the understanding of the Olympics. After an extensive exploratory data analysis, which shed light on medal distributions, athlete attributes, and evolving dynamics of medal achievements, data preprocessing ensued. The project culminated in predicting medal outcomes using a Random Forest Classifier, trained on data from 2000 onwards.
